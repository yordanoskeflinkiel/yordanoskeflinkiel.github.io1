        <h2>Sneak Peek: Project Development</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a sneak peek into my upcoming project. 
            What is currently present includes the initial object and control aspects. 
            I have watched various tutorials and explanations to reach this point, most notably PardCode's C++ game tutorial series. 
            Although I am not building a game, the videos have been really helpful in understanding the background processes. 
            The true challenge will come when I need to move beyond those tutorials and start implementing the proper code for a typical 3D rendering engine.

                    Initial Design Concept - The initial design concept I have in mind is very basic in terms of what I am able to do. 
                    I hope to replicate a similar interface to Blender, as it is software I am familiar with. 
                    However, there will be limitations and significantly fewer features compared to Blender.

                <p>
                    Here is a video demo of what has been completed so far. At this point, there is the initial creation of a temporary object, 
                    and the movements you see are controlled through the keyboard inputs of 'W', 'S', 'A', and 'D'. 
                    The next step is to enable mouse input, as well as set up viewpoints. 
                    Thankfully, the tutorials I have been following have been really helpful in understanding the background functionality.
