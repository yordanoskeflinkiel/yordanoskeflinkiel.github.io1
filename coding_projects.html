                <p>This project showcases the design and development of a Scissor Lift model, created as part of a engineering design course work <br>The project involved using SolidWorks to create a detailed 3D model of the lift, including its mechanical components, dimensions, and movement mechanisms. <br>Key features include the realistic simulation of the scissor lift's motion and the use of engineering principles to ensure structural stability and functionality. <br>The lift was designed to demonstrate how it could be applied in real-world scenarios, such as for industrial or construction use. <br>Here is the 3D model and associated documentation are complete and available for review.

                <p>This project came about quite unexpectedly.<br>
                    Iâ€™ve always had a strong interest in 3D development and CAD systems like Blender and SolidWorks, and one day, a thought crossed my mind: "What if I build my own system?"<br>
                    It was definitely one of the more ambitious ideas Iâ€™ve had, but it sparked my curiosity and set me on the path of creating my own 3D engine.<br>
                    Now, this is no small featâ€”most companies have entire teams dedicated to this kind of developmentâ€”but I was determined to explore the world of 3D engines on my own.<br>
                    At the moment, Iâ€™m in the early stages of the project. Iâ€™ve just started with some basic code to render a 3D object and handle user input from the keyboard and mouse.<br>
                    Iâ€™ve watched countless YouTube tutorials, read numerous forums, and even visited libraries to dive into books that explain the intricate details behind building this kind of software.<br>
                    Although this is very much a long-term project, itâ€™s something I thoroughly enjoy working on in my free time and learning more about as I go.<br>
                    Hopefully, Iâ€™ll reach a point where itâ€™s polished enough to showcase properly, but for now, hereâ€™s a sneak peek of what Iâ€™ve been working on.

                <p>This project is a task management system featuring comprehensive user registration implemented via PHP. <br>The main page displays all tasks, highlighting those that are recently completed, alongside a calendar. <br>The profile page allows users to modify various aspects of their profile, from passwords and usernames to profile pictures. <br>An 'Edit Task' button provides the functionality to directly modify any entered tasks. <br>Some limitations of this project include the lack of robust email authentication and challenges in structuring the calendar to accurately accommodate all months. <br>Building this project was enjoyable, and I opted for a "cute" interface style to add a touch of personality ðŸ˜Š

                <p>This project marks my first venture into using a C++ GUI. Originally, I planned to create a simple game, but I opted for a more practical approach with a simple note-taking app that I can use daily. <br>This project project had a few ups and downs from the GUI not opening to multiple system crashes however after some back and forth for quite a while, I was able to get it up and running. <br> The system allows for user to create notes that are stored as txt files, <br> notes are updated(so long as you click save) directly. You can also open any previous txt files and edit them in the app and save them.<br> Over all this is a simple application and still in the works, however I enjoyed working with C++ GUI and think this is a good step in my development career

                <p>Lastly, one of my coding projects is this website. I thought it was about time I created a simple portfolio website to showcase a few of my projects. I designed the interface to closely match my personal style and added unique touches to make it stand out. <br>I hope you enjoy or have enjoyed browsing around.
