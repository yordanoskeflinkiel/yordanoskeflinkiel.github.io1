                <p>This project is a task management system featuring comprehensive user registration implemented via PHP. <br>The main page displays all tasks, highlighting those that are recently completed, alongside a calendar. <br>The profile page allows users to modify various aspects of their profile, from passwords and usernames to profile pictures. <br>An 'Edit Task' button provides the functionality to directly modify any entered tasks. <br>Some limitations of this project include the lack of robust email authentication and challenges in structuring the calendar to accurately accommodate all months. <br>Building this project was enjoyable, and I opted for a "cute" interface style to add a touch of personality ðŸ˜Š

                <p>This project replicates a hotel booking site. Login and registration are implemented via PHP. <br>Upon logging in, users are directed to the main page where they can explore different room styles, accommodations offered, and pricing details. <br>When ready to book, users proceed to the booking page to select an available date, room amount, style, and the number of guests. <br>After booking, the details are accessible on their profile page. <br>Current limitations include authentication for payments and emails, as well as syncing between instagram social media occasonally going down. <br>This project is still under completion as it is more of a passive project, but the homepage is linked to showcase the general interface design ðŸ˜Š

                <p>This project marks my first venture into using a C++ GUI. Originally, I planned to create a simple game, but I opted for a more practical approach with a simple to-do list/note-taking app that I can use daily. <br>This project is currently in production, but given its straightforward design, I anticipate completing it relatively soon ðŸ˜Š

                <p>Lastly, one of my coding projects is this website. I thought it was about time I created a simple portfolio website to showcase a few of my projects. I designed the interface to closely match my personal style and added unique touches to make it stand out. <br>I hope you enjoy or have enjoyed browsing around.
