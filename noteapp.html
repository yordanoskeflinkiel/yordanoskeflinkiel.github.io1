            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This is my first ever GUI project using C++, where I've created a simple note-taking app.<br>
                In this application, you can jot down your thoughts and save them effortlessly.<br>
                The app allows you to create as many notes as you like in one go, with each note being saved as a separate text file.<br>
                This functionality ensures that your information is well-organized and easily accessible anytime you need it.</p>
            
        </section>
        

        <section id="features">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>The main features of this application include the ability to take down notes and save them directly as text files.<br>
                All notes save any changes made, provided you click the 'Save' button.<br>
                Another key feature is the ability to open existing text files within the application and edit them, with the option to save any modifications.<br>
                Overall, it is a straightforward, user-friendly note-taking app designed to streamline your note-keeping process.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section id="design">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>For the design, I opted for a straightforward layout to establish a clear vision of what I want the application to eventually look like. The interface features a heading at the top, followed by a list of files in the left column, which serves as a navigation panel.<br>
                The main portion of the screen is dedicated to a larger typing area. At the bottom, you will find essential controls like 'Save', 'New', 'Close', and 'Open' buttons.<br>
                This layout is intuitive and flows smoothly, enhancing user experience by making it easy to manage and navigate notes.</p>
            
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>For the future of the application, I aim to refine its aesthetics to achieve a sleeker look. While the current version effectively meets functional needs, enhancing the visual appeal is a priority to provide a more engaging user experience.<br>
                Additionally, I plan to address and resolve a few existing bugs, which should be straightforward fixes. These improvements will not only polish the application but also ensure smoother operation and user interaction.</p>
