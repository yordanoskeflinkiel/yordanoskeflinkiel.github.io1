            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm currently in my second year in a Bachelor of Engineering & Applied Science (Honors) in Mechanical Engineering. I made the decision to transition from Software Engineering, where I achieved a GPA of 3.80, to Mechanical Engineering to pursue my interest in aerospace and energy systems. <br>
                
                Through a combination of coursework, personal projects, and self-study, I’m building a solid foundation in engineering principles. My experience with 3D modeling tools such as SolidWorks and Blender has allowed me to design and simulate projects in energy and aerospace fields, where I’m particularly eager to make an impact. <br>
                
                While my cumulative GPA (CGPA) is 3.1, I’m proud of my academic journey and remain committed to continuous learning and growth. I see every challenge as an opportunity to improve and refine my skills. <br>
                
                Ultimately, my goal is to work in the aerospace industry, creating innovative and sustainable solutions in energy systems!

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering & Applied Science (Honors) program in Mechanical Engineering at Ontario Tech University, <br>

                Transitioning from Software Engineering, where I achieved a GPA of 3.80, has allowed me to focus on my passion for aerospace and energy systems. <br>
                
                I look forward to further advancing my skills and knowledge in the coming years, with the goal of contributing to innovative solutions in these fields.
